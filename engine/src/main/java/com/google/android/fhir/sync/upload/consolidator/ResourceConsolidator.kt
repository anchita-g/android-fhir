 * together with other components in the upload package to fulfill a specific upload strategy. After
 * a resource is uploaded to a remote FHIR server and a response is returned, we need to consolidate
 * any changes in the database, Examples of this would be, updating the lastUpdated timestamp field,
 * or deleting the local change from the database, or updating the resource IDs and payloads to
 * correspond with the serverâ€™s feedback.
